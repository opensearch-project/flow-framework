# This template creates a connector to the public OpenAI model service for GPT 3.5
# It then registers a model using that connector and deploys it.
#
# To use:
#  - update the "credential" field under the create_openai_connector node.
#
# After provisioning:
#  - returns a workflow ID
#  - use the status API to get the deployed model ID
