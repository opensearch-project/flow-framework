# This template creates a connectors to Claude v1 model on Bedrock
#
# It then creates tools in the Agent Framework to create a query assist agent.
#
# To use:
#  - update the "credential" fields under the create_claude_connector node.
#  - if needed, update region and endpoint
#
# After provisioning:
#  - returns a workflow ID
#  - use the status API to get the deployed model IDs and agent IDs
#  - use those models and agents to create a chat experience

            Human: You will be given a search response, summarize it as a concise paragraph while considering the following:
            User's question on index '${parameters.index}': ${parameters.question}
            PPL (Piped Processing Language) query used: ${parameters.query}

            Give some documents to support your point.
            Note that the output could be truncated, summarize what you see. Don't mention about total items returned and don't mention about the fact that output is truncated if you see 'Output is too long, truncated' in the response.

            Skip the introduction; go straight into the summarization.

            Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.
            If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

            Human: You will be given an API response with errors, summarize it as a concise paragraph. Do not try to answer the user's question.
            If the error cannot be fixed, eg. no such field or function not supported, then give suggestions to rephrase the question.
            It is imperative that you must not give suggestions on how to fix the error or alternative PPL query, or answers to the question.

            Consider the following:
            User's question on index '${parameters.index}': ${parameters.question}
